# Starcraft Crew

This project was specially designed for the git course made by Curiosity.

The project is forked by a custom account created for the course, in order to make it easier to review the contribution of the participants in each sesion.

To visualize the crew online [click here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/curiosity-starcraft/starcraft-crew/blob/master/index.html) using a network connection without restrictions and give it a time to load!

## Getting Started

The goal is to create your own presentation card with which you are going to be identified as part of the crew.  Try your best, be specific and have fun while learning!

2. Have studied the whole course and approved all the exams
3. Have an enthusiastic attitude! Remember, you are a valuable part of the crowd.
